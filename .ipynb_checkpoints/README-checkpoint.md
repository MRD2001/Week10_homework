# Week10_homework
A Yen for the Future - Time Series &amp; Linear Regression Forecasting

In this assignment, we will test the many time series tools that we have learned in order to predict future movements in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the Japanese yen.

The homework consists of the following tasks:

Time series forecasting
Linear regression modelling

## Time series Forecasting

In this notebook, we will load historical CAD-JPY exchange rate data in a CSV file format, and apply time series analysis and modelling to determine if there is any predictable behaviour.

### the Hodrick-prescott filter

### the ARMA model

### the ARIMA model

### the GARCH model

> The results of the time series analysis should give us guidance about the yen prices in the future. 





## Linear Regression Forecasting

In this notebook, you will build a Scikit-Learn linear regression model to predict CAD/JPY returns with lagged CAD/JPY futures returns and categorical calendar seasonal effects (e.g., day-of-week or week-of-year seasonal effects).


Data preparation (creating returns and lagged returns, and splitting the data into training and testing data)
Fitting a linear regression model.
Making predictions using the testing data.
Out-of-sample performance.
In-sample performance.
